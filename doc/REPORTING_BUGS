Reporting Bugs

   If you encounter any problems while using avelsieve, you would be much
   appreciated to send a bug report.

   Please follow these steps:
    1. Edit your configuration file (config/config.php) and set
       AVELSIEVE_DEBUG to 1.
    2. Try to recreate the problem. If it has happened due to the
       generated script being incorrect, then when avelsieve tries to
       upload the script again, this will generate the error and the whole
       SIEVE script will appear on the output.
    3. Email a copy of this script, the error message and a description of
       what you did to trigger it, to the email address avel @
       users.sourceforge.net.
