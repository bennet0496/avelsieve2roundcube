Devel Series (1.9.x)

  1.9.9 ALPHA - Devel Branch

     * New feature: Support for the Sieve Date Extension. This allows
       conditions and tests against the message's date/time, or the date
       and time during the execution of the Sieve script.
     * New feature: Support for the Sieve Index Extension. This allows for
       checks against a specific header index (for instance, the second
       Received: header counting from the last one).
     * New feature: Support for the Sieve IMAP4Flags Extension. This
       allows additional Sieve actions that set specific IMAP flags or
       labels to messages. Standard IMAP4 flags, Thunderbird labels and
       even custom labels are supported.
     * New User Interface: the condition of a rule is now dynamically
       driven via Javascript. New conditions can be added or changed
       on-the-fly via AJAX, without reloading the entire page. Also,
       dynamic blocks within a single condition are supported.
     * All Javascript functions are now under the AVELSIEVE namespace so
       as not to pollute the global namespace.
     * Vacation action has been renamed to "Vacation / Autoresponder",
       since now it will be used more often for out-of-office- or
       out-of-service- style notices because of the date-time feature.
     * New Debug options in config.php, allow testing of avelsieve
       features without the actual feature existing on the server.
     * Eliminate PHP Notice in STARTTLS check in ManageSieve library.
     * Bugfix: Rule actions icons should now be properly
       vertically-aligned.
     * This release is sponsored by Alexey Melnikov and by ellak.gr.

  1.9.8 ALPHA - Devel Branch

     * A large part of the code that is the part of the rule editing
       procedure has been rewritten, in order to accomodate for a more
       flexible way to add new types of rules. The special "SPAM rule" has
       been rewritten to comply with this scheme.
     * A new-style SPAM rule has been implemented. (Rule #11)
     * Split custom SPAM Sieve rule building to its own file
       (include/sieve_buildrule.10.inc.php); this allows for easier
       defining of customized rules, too.
     * A new, global Whitelist rule (Rule #12) has been implemented, for
       the SPAM rules to take advantage of.
     * New, "Custom Sieve Code" rule (Rule #13) has been implemented; this
       allows users to enter directly Sieve code snippets as a rule. This
       feature is still alpha / experimental, and needs a rework on the
       error handling, when there are parse errors. Feature contributed by
       Konstantinos Koukopoulos (kouk /at/ noc.uoa.gr)
     * Miscellaneous code movement and restructuring. The processing of
       user input has been moved to the rule classes; addspamrule.php has
       been replaced with the class that extends the edit class; an
       intermediate class for SPAM-rules has been implemented; better
       object consistency is followed.
     * UI: The "Add New Rule" buttons are now links, and are displayed
       both at the top and at the bottom of the rule table.
     * UI: Major rework in the UI of both the Rules Table and the Add New
       Rule / Edit Rule pages. The buttons and links have been rearranged
       for better usability, many messages have been changed, visual clues
       have been introduced, options and help texts are hidden with
       Javascript etc.
     * UI: If a vacation rule is active, then display a notice in the
       rules table page and upon logging in to Squirrelmail, that reminds
       the user. (Idea inspired with help by Joel Davis)
     * UI: Vacation options have been aligned properly; text has been
       changed accordingly.
     * Sieve: Vacation Subject is now supported.
     * New functionality: "Insert New Rule Here"
     * New functionality: "Move Rule to Position" (requires Javascript)
     * Avelsieve now highly recommends the use of javascript_libs plugin
       for some visual effects / UI improvements.
     * UI: Added new icons and used different ones, to improve usability.
       Icons are provided by Mark James' [1]famfamfam.com.
     * UI: Added new icon "theme" based also on famfamfam.com. This theme
       is the default from now on.
     * UI: Removed unnecessary text / clutter from rules table page.
     * UI: The notify action options have been aligned in a table.
     * Added an LDAP Sieve storage backend, compatible with [2]Sun
       Messaging Server's Sieve features. Kindly contributed by: Laurent
       Buset, Pascal Maes and Boris Maroutaeff of [3]Universite catholique
       de Louvain.
     * The DO_Sieve_* backends should have a separate retrieve() method
       for retrieving the raw Sieve script. Currently, only the
       Managesieve backend has it.
     * Various phpdocumentor fixes.
     * Bugfix: When editing rule with redirect action, the 'keep' option
       was always checked. (Thanks to Jonathan Lumpkin).
     * Version check for Squirrelmail search integration is performed
       outside of plugin registration. Ensures compatibility with
       Squirrelmail CVS as of 2006-10-15 and Squirrelmail 1.5.2.
     * Hook registrations have been updated to be Squirrelmail-compatible
       (as of SM-1.5 SVN HEAD 2007-01-17). Thanks to Marc Groot Koerkamp!
     * Initial "configtest" module for Squirrelmail's configuration test.
     * Bugfix: The notify action is displayed only if the notify
       capability exists.
     * Bugfix: The notify method is displayed properly in the verbose
       rules table.
     * Bugfix: When displaying as "source", also display the disabled
       status.
     * Bugfix: Allow empty vacation :addresses field again. (Thanks to
       Satadru Pramanik)
     * Bugfix: Authorization login for Squirrelmail 1.5 CVS with authz
       plugin now works.
     * Moved Javascript logic to its own file, and cleaned up edit.php so
       that it will load the javascript separately when it is a popup
       window.
     * Added new helper / javascript functions in
       include/html_main.inc.php: js_toggle_display(), determineState(),
       stateCheckbox(), stateVisibility(), to help with
       javascript-enhanced UI.
     * New concept of a "unique" rule: this type of Sieve rule can only
       exist once in a Sieve script, because UI-wise it would not make
       sense to have a lot of them. For example, the new junk mail rule
       and the whitelist are such constructs.
     * New concept for "undeletable" rule. This cannot be deleted from the
       UI. The purpose is to allow more user-friendly junk mail or
       predefined rules. The new junk mail rule is such a rule.
     * The "tech" description of the rules was very similar to "terse",
       did not offer anything UI-wise but clutter and therefore has been
       removed completely.
     * More appropriate style for the "source" display of rules.
     * Gathered all CSS styles used, in include/styles.inc.php
     * New functionality for returning back to another page, after editing
       a rule. Useful for editing Junk Mail options, Whitelist, custom
       rules made from messages etc.
     * Junk Mail Options are accessible from folder "INBOX.Junk" or
       "Junk", as well as from Options Page.
     * Version and info functions have been adjusted for greater
       Squirrelmail-guidelines compliance.
     * Corrected header X-Mailing-List in the default select box for
       header matching. (Thanks to Jan Hauke Rahm)
     * Configuration files are now split on a per-customized-rule basis,
       making it a bit easier to upgrade avelsieve.
     * Minor comsetic changes in debug mode output, until a better error
       handling is available for the Data Object classes.
     * Remove unused / badly designed 'frontend' option from sieve actions
       classes.
     * Bugfix: When there are no capabilities to be "required", don't
       output an empty require [] line. ( Stephan Bosch)
     * Bugfix: in the ManageSieve library, ignore case for the available
       capabilities. ( Stephan Bosch)
     * Fixes in ManageSieve library with regard to deleting scripts and
       making avelsieve operational with Dovecot IMAP server, tickets
       #246, #247.
     * TLS option in ManageSieve can be explicitly disabled.
     * Allow the + (plus) character in email addresses field of forward
       action so that subaddressing is possible; thanks to Philipp
       Dreimann.
     * Fixed typo (regural -> regular)
     * Fixed typo in default config file (header X-MailingList became
       X-Mailing-List). Thanks to Debian package maintainer Jan Hauke
       Rahm.

  1.9.7 - Devel Branch

     * Compatible with Squirrelmail 1.5.2 (new init scheme).
     * Add STARTTLS feature for ManageSieve class (thanks to Anish Mistry)
     * All HTML markup is now valid HTML 4.01. Page display should work in
       Konqueror properly.
     * Small improvement in order to make the plugin usable for
       non-javascript users.
     * Bugfix: When adding a new rule and an error occurs, then do not
       lose any changes applied so far.
     * Bugfix: Typo in edit.php, prevented rule from being added
       dynamically (e.g. from Search Results or from Message View) when
       the Filters page had not been previously loaded.
     * Bugfix: Due to a programming error, the wrong capabilities were
       required in the Sieve script.
     * Bugfix: Capabilities check is performed correctly.
     * Bugfix: Body Sieve code lacked spaces: body :contains"foo" , which
       resulted in syntax error.
     * Bugfix: Now actually display link to create filter in search
       integration feature, when Compose in new window is true.
     * Bugfix: Search Integration: When no search criteria could be
       expressed as sieve rules, then the Create Filter link is not
       displayed.
     * Bugfix: Create Folder when adding rule sometimes did not work.
     * Bugfix: Nasty bug that only showed up with Opera and large (>200
       chars) Vacation Addresses: field. The "Edit" form would not be
       submitted correctly when Addresses was > 200 chars. Also submitted
       bug #221983 to Opera.
     * Cleaned up the skeleton file for new backends.

  1.9.6 - Devel Branch

     * Add support for multiple Sieve script "storage" backends. Sieve
       scripts can be stored to and retrieved from a ManageSieve server,
       the filesystem or a remote machine. Currently, only the ManageSieve
       backend is implemented, but it is very easy to write other backends
       as well.
     * Add initial support for [4]Exim4 and [5]MFL Sieve scripts.
     * Bugfix: The delete operations did not save the rules immediately in
       "non-conservative" mode. (Simon Matter)
     * Bugfix: Allow 1 day length between vacation messages, instead of
       >1. (Simon Matter)
     * Bugfix: Properly require "body" (thanks to Anthony).
     * Workaround: Only enable Search Integration feature if in
       Squirrelmail Devel branch (1.5.x) (Simon Matter)

  1.9.5 - Devel Branch

     * New Feature: In Squirrelmail Search page, a user can now easily add
       a new server-side Sieve rule based on the criteria that are
       described in the Search interface.
     * Actually honor variable $translate_return_msgs. (Thanks to R. Welz)
     * Bugfix: Capability of Envelope is now properly detected and the
       proper Sieve require command is used. (Thanks to R. Welz)
     * Bugfix: When no action has been selected, explicitly select 'keep'
       as the default.
     * Bugfix: IMAP Server to Sieve Server mapping.
     * Improved error message printing. Properly translate error messages
       that relate to connection errors to timsieved. PHP warnings are
       suppressed during these connection errors.
     * In deletion of rules: Redirection is performed so as to eliminate
       the 'rm' GET parameter. (User could do "Reload Frame" in browser
       and delete more rules by mistake).
     * Internal: Changed all ManageSieve wrapper functions to have the
       Sieve handler as the first function argument. Also changed all
       script-related functions to have the script name as an argument.
       This will allow for interface of management of multiple scripts in
       a future version.
     * Internal: Implemented avelsieve_initialize() which removes a lot of
       duplicate code. Misc. other cleanups have been made as well.
     * Better naming for various functions and configuration parameters,
       so as to avoid collision with other functions or variables in
       Squirrelmail.
     * Updated German Translation (Karsten Behrens)
     * Updated Greek Translation (Alexandros Vellis)
     * Added Bulgarian Translation (Ognyan Kulev)
     * Removed some left-over debug output from 1.9.4 release.

  1.9.4 beta - Devel Branch (3/1/2006)

     * Reorganized the internal structure of the rule condition. Now there
       is a cond array, in which all conditions are stored. Different
       types of conditions can be mixed in the same rule, for instance:
       "envelope FROM contains foo or Address From: contains foo". Proper
       migration from intrelnal structure of versions <= 1.9.3 is
       (hopefully) performed.
     * Envelope, Address and Body capabilities / extensions are now fully
       supported.
     * Implemented proper validation for some of the fields entered by the
       user, such as in the 'redirect' and 'vacation' email addresses.
     * The automatic creation of rules, invoked when reading a message,
       now creates rules of type "address".
     * Inserted squirrelmail plugin hooks, intended for new plugins that
       extend avelsieve's functionality.
     * Workaroune for a bug where avelsieve could not upload the script,
       when only one rule was disabled. (Thanks to Bethke Peter)
     * Processing of rules from user input (_POST etc.) is more robust.
     * When a folder does not exist, or is not accessible, and this same
       folder is refered to in a rule's fileinto action, then a warning
       message is displayed to the user.
     * Added new configuration options:

     * $avelsieve_oldcyrus: In Cyrus 2.3+, the notification action is
       fully supported, as opposed to older Cyrus versions. The oldcyrus
       variable is for supporting the partially implemented notify
       extension implementation of Cyrus < 2.3. If you have Cyrus < 2.3,
       just set this to true. This only changes the informational / help
       text displayed in avelsieve.
     * $avelsieve_enable_envelope_auth: If you have Cyrus with an lmtpd
       that can understand the "auth" argument to the :envelope test as
       the SMTP/LMTP auth, or any other Sieve implementation than can
       understand the authentication ID, then you can enable this to
       provide this functionality to the user.
       This was not clarified in the base spec of RFC 3028. It will be
       done correctly in a new version of Cyrus, based on a new draft /
       spec.
     * $avelsieve_spam_highlight_enable: A boolean option that turns on
       the creation of a highlight rule in the message highlight options
       of Squirrelmail. (Note: needs a patch in Squirrelmail code, which
       hasn't been released yet).

     Updated ManageSieve class to 0.9.0 CVS. Notable changes from its
   changelog:
     * Applied REFERRAL fixes for Cyrus v2.2 / v2.3, by Duncan Gibb of
       Sirius Corporation
     * Fix curly braces '{' escaping, to work correctly in PHP 5.1.
       (Thanks to Oded Arbel).

     Debug option is now placed in configuration file (config/config.php).

     A warning is entered in the script, that if it is edited manually,
   the changes will not be reflected in the GUI.

     Slightly modified dumpr (Licence: LGPL) is included in the
   distribution for purposes of debugging.

     In Squirrelmail 1.5.x, while editing a rule, the complete, sorted
   folder listing is displayed in the select box. (Original patch by Simon
   Matter).

  1.9.3 beta - Devel Branch (27/6/2005)

     * Fix for compatibility with PHP5.
     * Corrected the handling of specified notification methods.
     * Bugfix: Proper parsing of lines > 1024 characters. An unneeded
       newline was being added to the stream while getting ther rule. Many
       thanks to Jan Klepal.
     * Bugfix: Don't print the values of the header match rules twice!
     * Updated Spanish Locale (Eduardo Mayoral)
     * Corrected Norwegian locale: updated moved existing norwegian
       translation to Norwegian Bokmal directory. (Thanks to Hans F.
       Nordhaug for correcting my mistakes).
     * Added more AVELSIEVE_DEBUG hooks to help people report bugs. Added
       REPORTING_BUGS help text.

  1.9.2 beta - Devel Branch (15/3/2005)

     * New functionality to Enable / Disable Rules, original patch by
       Simon Matter. Rules can be disabled temporarily by the user and not
       be deleted altogether. The GUI for the actions in the rules table
       has been sorted out.
     * Endoding and decoding of script, between UTF-8 and Squirrelmail's
       charset, is now done more robustly; recode and iconv functions are
       supported, aside from multibyte string functions.
     * The terse description of the filtering rules has been updated with
       more friendly strings, which are now i18n-able.
     * There are two new display modes for the table of filtering rules, a
       more terse ("techy-style" aka geeky) display and a SIEVE source
       display.
     * The display mode is saved in Squirrelmail Preferences instead of
       the Session. Therefore, it can now stay persistent across Webmail
       sessions.
     * Squirrelmail's top links are now displayed again in the Rule
       Editing window, when it is not a popup.
     * Fixed bug introduced in Devel series, where notification action
       could not be removed. (Thanks to Christos Soulios).
     * While Editing a rule, this action has been reinstated: keepdeleted
       ("keep a copy in INBOX, marked as deleted"). Also the 'disabled'
       action is there, too.
     * These actions, such as stop, notify, keepdeleted, disabled are now
       in a separate section in the Edit Rule page.
     * Avelsieve can now parse a redirect parameter with multiple space-
       or comma-separated emails, and print out multiple redirect
       statements in the SIEVE script.
     * Descriptive text for Notify action (short version) now shows the
       destination address.
     * Added X-List-Name: to the default list of headers listbox, as it is
       used by Majordomo. Suggested by Florin Andrei.
     * Polish translation by Martin Przybylek.
     * Dutch translation by Maxim Baars.

  1.9.1 beta - Devel Branch (22/12/2004)

     * Fix off-by-one serious error in MANAGESIEVE class. The bug could
       DoS the Apache server by getting PHP into an endless loop.
       [6](Sourceforge Bug Tracker Link)
     * Corrected handling of Whitelist values in SPAM Rule. Previously, in
       Advanced SPAM Rule Creation, a SPAM Rule that had no effect could
       be created because a wrong whitelist value would be enabled. This
       fix also improved the GUI behavior (Nikos Voutsinas).
     * The [7]sieve-php(MANAGESIEVE) class can now handle REFERALS (patch
       by Michael Loftis).
     * Added Mailing-List to the default headers select box, as suggested
       by Florin Andrei.
     * Made some input textboxes handle larger text (changed maxlength).
     * Enabled STOP by default in new SPAM rule.
     * Do not use function call-time pass-by-reference, for better
       compatibility with PHP4/5.

  1.9.0 alpha - Devel Branch (22/11/2004)

     * New feature: A mail filtering rule can be created on-the-fly while
       reading a message in Squirrelmail. The algorithm is similar to
       other MUAs: First a check is done if the mail belongs to a mailing
       list, then a check on the sender and destination addresses, and
       lastly the Subject is taken into account.
     * The Edit Rule page has been redesigned. Specifically:

     * The type of rule (size match, header match etc.) can be changed
       on-the-fly.
     * Action Options are displayed only when the relevant action has been
       selected.
     * On-the-fly new folder creation now works properly, with better
       error handling.
     * The page takes into account user's preferences on new popup windows
       and javascript options.

     The Edit Rule page can now add a new rule.

     The Add new Rule Wizard has been obsoleted by the revamped Edit Rule
   page.

     Completely rewritten a lot of the code that handles the GUI parts of
   avelsieve. The code is written in a way so that new GUI frontends can
   be written a bit more easily.

     The "More..." button in Spam Rule Whitelist now adds items properly.

     As always, code cleanups all around.

Stable Series (1.0.x)

  1.0.1 - Stable (22/12/2004)

     * Added GIF images for Internet Explorer compatibility. IE cannot
       handle PNG transparency normally.
     * Removed $text$ and $text[n]$ from notification help, since it is
       [11]not supported by Cyrus yet.
     * Fixed tools URL so as not to end in &, since some proxys complain
       for invalid URL (Simon Matter)
     * Locale bug fixes (Karsten Behrens)
     * Gettext template is now named correctly (avelsieve.pot). Gettext
       with PHP mode is used.
     * Ldapuserdata mode allows getting email addresses from LDAP
       identities, provided by LDAP Prefs Backend plugin.
     * If there is only one notification method available, don't display a
       drop down widget.
     * When editing a rule with notification action, the saved
       notification parameters will be displayed correctly. (Chris
       Winterrowd)
     * Bugfix: If there is one rule left, it can be deleted normally
       again. For good this time. (Hopefully).
     * Small bugfix: Last modification date is displayed properly.
     * Updated German Translation (Karsten Behrens)
     * Updated Lithuanian Translation (Tomas Kuliavas)

  0.9.6 (29/9/2003)

     * Scripts are properly encoded in UTF-8. Backward compatibility with
       previous versions is preserved -- if version < 0.9.6, no decoding
       is done. (Thanks to Tomas Kuliavas for his help).
     * Information about creation date and last modification date of the
       script is displayed.
     * Support for imapproxy; if you enable the new option imapproxymode
       in config.php, you can also define a mapping from the imapproxy
       server (usually localhost) to the real IMAP/SIEVE server, since
       imapproxy cannot understand MANAGESIEVE.
     * Bugfix: The last rule can be deleted normally again. (Broken in
       0.9.5). Thanks to Joseph Tate.
     * Supports the [12]different authentication & authorization patch,
       i.e. displays the script of the authorized user.
     * SASL PLAIN in sieve-php.lib.php has been fixed so as to correctly
       pass the authorization identity.
     * You can enable AVELSIEVE_DEBUG mode in table.php, for
       troubleshooting and debugging avelsieve easily.

  0.9.5 (12/9/2003)

   Mostly a bugfix release.
     * Now escaping of \ and " are done properly.
     * Corrected some htmlspecialchars() declarations while building the
       script.
     * When wrong (non-parsable) script is created, the script can be
       displayed for debugging purposes and to help send me a bug report
       so as to fix it! Uncomment the relevant lines in sieve.php, line
       #62, to enable this.
     * Fixed "Move to bottom" functionality (Simon Matter)
     * Some more minor bug fixes.
     * Updated Spanish translation (Eduardo Mayoral)
     * Updated Greek translation.

  0.9.4 (1/9/2003)

   Note: Since there are some changes in the configuration file, I suggest
   that you use the supplied config.php file and import back any changes
   you have made afterwards.
     * XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Security Bug Fixed. Upgrading to version
       0.9.4 is strongly encouraged. Thanks to "David F. Madrid" for
       bringing the problem to my attention.
     * Avelsieve version information is stored in the SIEVE script, for
       backward compatibility reasons.
     * If the user is using identities, all her email addresses are
       displayed in the vacation input box. ([13]Pascal Schelcher)
       [Previously this would work only when LDAP Prefs Backend was
       enabled]
     * Added configuration option to force-disable certain SIEVE
       capabilities, so as not to be displayed in the GUI. For instance,
       you can disable the display of notify or vacation options, even
       though timsieved supports (& advertises) them. (Idea inspired by
       Chris Winterrowd)
     * Added config option for preferred SASL authentication mechanisms to
       use.
     * Added move to top / bottom functionality in the rules table, so as
       to quickly reorder the rules.
     * Removed obsolete and incomplete image themes; now there are two
       complete themes: Plain-Bluecurve style (16x16) and GTK-BlueCurve
       style (24x24), the latter being the default.
     * Created interface for new "tools" (along with create, duplicate,
       edit etc.) to be created easily: function
       avelsieve_print_toolicon()
     * Formalized code comments and brought them up to date; now using
       Javadoc-style comments.
     * When editing an existing rule, notify method is displayed
       correctly.
     * Added Romanian translation (Marius Onica)
     * Lots of code cleanups.

  0.9.3 (1/8/2003)

     * GUI issue resolved; when choosing to create a new folder or when
       selecting an existing folder, the corresponding radio button is
       selected automatically.
     * Added translation to Lithuanian, by Tomas Kuliavas
     * Added translation to Brazilian Portuguese, by Gleydson Mazioli da
       Silva
     * Updated German translation (Karsten Behrens)
     * Updated Finnish translation (Veli Pirttila)
     * Added version information per Squirrelmail plugins guidelines.

  0.9.2 (9/6/2003)

     * Error handling in the creation of a new folder whilst adding a new
       rule has been reenabled, and greatly enhanced with some pretty
       error checking & handling.
     * While editing a rule, the fileinto folder option looks nicer.
     * Removed the dependancy of sieve-php.lib on extension mhash.so, if
       DIGEST-MD5 is used. Many thanks to [14]Chris Hilts!
     * Updated .po file problems, and merged them with the new strings
       that have appeared around the code. Also introduced translation
       statistics to keep track of the translations.

  0.9.1 (30/5/2003)

     * Buggy backward-compatibility code was removed. Now Squirrelmail 1.4
       is a requirement.
     * Bugfix release, moving to a stable and bug free (hopefully)
       1.0-"final".
     * At last, 100% register_globals=off compatible!
     * At long last, 100% error_reporting=E_ALL compatible! (Or 99%, until
       version 1.0).
     * Alternative sieve-php.lib is provided, for the people who don't
       want the dependancy on mhash.so. (Please provide a patch if you'd
       like some nicer way).
     * Problems with a table with no filters being displayed instead of
       the introductory message were fixed once more.
     * Localization issues for these messages have been taken care of.
     * Now vacation email is always set by default. If user does not
       specify email addresses, Squirrelmail's From: Address is used.
       Handling of email addresses was fixed. If the LDAP prefs backend
       (ldapuserdata plugin) is used, it can be configured to get all
       addresses from the LDAP attributes mail and mailAlternateAddress.
     * Creating a new folder when adding a new rule has been temporarily
       disabled. Will be reenabled in 0.9.2.
     * When editing an existing rule, notify parameters are displayed and
       saved correctly.
     * Switching between verbose and terse mode is now saved correctly
       (for the session).
     * Added Norwegian translation (Alexander Brill)
     * Added Icelandic translation (THor Sigurässon)
     * Updated Greek translation (Alexandros Vellis).

  0.9 (23/4/2003)

     * Made it Squirrelmail 1.4.x-compatible again! (My compatibility code
       seems to break compatibility :-/ )
     * Various small fixes and cleanups.
     * This is the last "stable" version, and the last one to support
       Squirrelmail 1.2.x. From now on, please either upgrade to
       Squirrelmail 1.4.x or use the compatibility plugin.

  0.9pre5 (25/2/2003)

     * Made it Squirrelmail 1.2.x-compatible again; it now includes
       Squirrelmail's function sqGetGlobalVar() for those who haven't
       upgraded yet. Sorry for the inconvenience!

  0.9pre4 (25/2/2003)

     * Bug fix: When entering the Filters screen for the first time, a
       table with an empty line was produced for the first time... (Daniel
       Henninger)
     * Renamed support.php so as to avoid conflicts with twc_weather
       plugin (Ryan Press)
     * Forgot to remove debugging code in 0.9pre3...
     * Fixed session problems; now uses Squirrelmail's session functions
       from global.php
     * Simplified and deleted a lot of code by removing the option for
       non-conservative connections
     * Added partial greek translation.

  0.9pre3 (21/1/2003)

     * Supports [15]Sieve - notify extension
     * Updated French Translation (John Cotter)

  0.9pre2 (11/12/2002)

     * Works with register_globals = Off!
     * Works with Squirrelmail 1.3.2+ !. Uses SM_PATH and friends.
     * Backward-compatible with Squirrelmail 1.2 (does version checking).
     * New way to display the description of a rule: either verbose (as
       previously) or terse. The display mode is saved in a session.
     * Now supports [16]Sieve regexp extension.
     * Delete Selected Rules now works correctly!
     * Fixed the newlines in the vacation message (from \n to \r\n) and
       made it support multi-line text as well. (Christian Schneider,
       Martin Schipany).
     * Translation of the messages returned by the Reject and Vacation
       actions is now configurable in config.php, and turned off by
       default (i.e. predefined messages are in English). You can turn it
       back on, if you are on an intranet environment or somewhere you
       know most communication is happening in the same language.
     * A lot of small bug fixes, code cleanups, HTML cleanups.

  0.9pre1 (19/11/2002)

     * Supports the matches wildcard glob-style operator for header
       matches (many thanks to [17]Christian Schneider for his code!).
     * Also supports various [18]Sieve relational tests for the header
       match, like greater than or equal to etc. Also added some headers
       like X-Priority: and X-Spam-Flag: (credits to Mathias Homann for
       this one ;))
     * A new option to keep a message flagged as deleted in user's inbox.
       ([19]Christian Schneider).
     * sieve-php.lib was patched so that various SIEVE extensions are now
       detected automatically. So, if an implementation does not support
       vacation, this functionality will not appear to the user. The
       capabilities supported so far are: fileinto, reject, vacation,
       imapflags, relational. Also, body and regexp will be supported
       soon!
     * In the rules table, a "Delete Selected Rules" button together with
       the checkboxes is now available (although a bit buggy!). Also the
       code got much more simplified and cleaned up.
     * Started implementing [20]SIEVE: Body Extension.
     *

  0.8 (6/11/2002)

     * More superglobal arrays and register_globals=off fixes.
     * Editing a rule should work now well, even for rules with header
       matches et al.
     * Added some more headers in the combo box, like X-Spam-Flag (through
       config.php).

  0.8pre7 (8/10/2002)

     * Fix for $items handling - made that superglobal too. The header
       match screen should display properly now. (Bjoern T Johansen)
     * i18n fix for installations that use Squirrelmail's gettext hack
       instead of PHP's gettext module (Stefan Rapp).

  0.8pre6 (4/10/2002)

     * Added translation to simplified Chinese, by [21]Jack Gao
     * Locale and gettext fixes (Torsten Westermann).

  0.8pre5 (30/9/2002)

     * Major new feature: A rule can now be edited.
     * Major rework on the appearance. Now all the pages look even better,
       and more like the rest of the Squirrelmail interface.
     * Added checkbox widgets, so that many rules can be deleted at once.
     * Now uses superglobal arrays everywhere (e.g. _$SESSION instead of
       the deprecated $HTTP_SESSION_VARS). Possibly works with
       register_globals turned off (not yet tested).
     * Renamed files from '.inc' to '.php', for security reasons and
       consistency.
     * User-interface cleanups, more friendly messages when a rule has
       been deleted, added or updated.
     * Fixed bugs with regard to gettext messages and including files.
     * Added French translation by [22]Juan-Francisco Diez
     * Code cleanup. Mailbox list printing is now a function; added other
       files such as constants.php and process_input.php.
     * Miscellaneous other code cleanups.

  0.7 -- Skipped (6/2002)

     * Fixed the style sheet in addrule.php. Now it looks just like the
       rest of the Squirrelmail interface - it uses the same header. This
       hopefully fixes the layout on some pages in konqueror (kde3.0.1)
       and Netscape 6. (Torsten Westermann for the idea).
     * Bugfix: spare quote in addrule_html.inc was deleted. Now the Clear
       this form button works in konqueror. (Torsten Westermann)
     * Added spanish translation by [23]Eduardo Mayoral .
     * Translations and gettext bug fixes. Now the localization should
       work normally, everywhere. Hopefully. Fixed the "The header"
       string.
     * More path and cwd fixes. Now everything is chdir'ed to plugins/ as
       it should be.
     * Bugfix: the locale .mo files need not be copied to the global
       locale dir.
     * Folders drop-down widgets have been changed to show a tabbed view
       of the tree and to support modified-UTF-7-encoded folder names, for
       international folder names.

  0.6 (29/5/2002)

     * New feature: When adding a new header rule, at step 2 a user can
       define many if statements, which will all be ANDed or ORed. The GUI
       was sorted out as well. Rows of statements can be added or removed
       dynamically with submit buttons. The maximum number of statements
       inside the rule, as well as the starting number of statements and
       the headers to display in the listbox, are now all
       administrator-definable, in config.php.
     * Added i18n hooks and support for gettext.
     * Added german translation by Torsten Westermann.
     * Added russian translation by [24]Vadim Kozlov.
     * Added Features, bugs sections in documentation.

  0.5 (19/4/2002)

     * Fixed a bug that triggered when a user decided to click somewhere
       else (e.g. on a folder in the folder list frame) when adding a
       rule, and then wanted to come back and add a rule.
     * Fixed another bug having to do with strange chdir()s (again).
       Strange that these don't occur in my PHP installation. Thanks to
       Martin (no further info ;-)).
     * Added GNOME themes for the icons.
     * Changed status to beta. :)

  0.4 (4/4/2002)

     * Fixed the hook function name. Thanks to Nick Sayer for reporting
       this.
     * Fixed (hopefully) a bug that appeared when user deleted all the
       rules. Apparently, a script with just a require line was created.
       Again, thanks to Nick Sayer.
     * Fixed a small chdir problem in table.php. Thanks to Stephane
       Bonnell and Claus Nielsen.
     * Changed the overall behaviour: no more if { ... } elseif {... }
       else { ...}. Now, every rule is in its own if block. Also added the
       option to stop processing any rules. This means that the default
       rule stuff is now obsolete. So, now every rule is checked against,
       until the end of the script or until a stop statement is found.
       (David Mendenhall)
     * Instead of a default rule (aka else statement), one can select "All
       Messages" in the rule type (step 1), thus defining an "if (true)"
       rule that will apply everywhere. (David Mendenhall)
     * Added vacation functionality. (David Mendenhall)
     * Added the options "does not contain" and "is not", along with their
       positive counterparts, in the header match if clause. (David
       Mendenhall)
     * Eye candy: Added images for the move up / move down / delete
       buttons. It is even themable (from an administrator's point of view
       ANW).
     * Add the option to create a new folder "on the fly", when adding a
       new rule (in step 3). The error handling, though, is very poor.
       Therefore, this feature is for testing only - and disabled by
       default in config.php.
     * The text at some places is nicer and more user-friendly. (David
       Mendenhall)
     * Prevent wrapping on the options column in table.php.
     * Added a STOP icon in step 3 of addrule.php. ;)
     * Removed obsolete files htmlprint.inc and htmlfunc2.inc. Somehow
       they survived. :-)
     * Added gray_plain theme. (David Mendenhall)

  0.3

     * Introduced an option to be conservative on the connections to SIEVE
       daemon. Uses cached variables in the PHP session, but requires the
       user to logout after she's done with her changes. This feature is
       still under development.
     * Move Up / Move Down functionality in the rules table.
     * Added config.php for setting options.
     * Fixed a bug that triggered when one pressed Cancel while adding a
       rule, and then tried to add another rule.
     * Some code cleanup in table.php. Debug messages that showed up are
       now hidden. Made the function upload_script().
     * The integration with SM is just a little better; the theme colors
       are now taken into account, in both table.php and addrule.php. :-)

  0.2

     * Added "default rule" functionality, that is, the much anticipated
       "else" clause. :-) If not used, the default remains SIEVE's
       implicit keep, i.e. fileinto INBOX, accordingly to the SIEVE RFC.
     * Miscellaneous code cleanup -- it's still pretty much a mess though.
     * Added it to the official [25]Squirrelmail plugins site.

  0.1

     * First public release.
     * Modified it to work as a squirrelmail plugin.

  Pre 0.1

     * It started as a standalone script, built on top of Dan Ellis' test
       scripts that come with sieve-php.lib.
