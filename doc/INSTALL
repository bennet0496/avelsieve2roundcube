Installing for the first time
-----------------------------

1) Untar the plugin under the squirrelmail/plugins directory. You probably have
already done this. :)

2) Copy config/config_sample.php to config/config.php. Edit config.php to your
preferences.  The file is self-documented with comments.

The defaults are OK for most installations.

3) Install Javascript Libraries plugin (Highly Recommended)

For the development release 1.9.8, at the moment you will also need the
javascript_libs squirrelmail "library" plugin. Just grab the following file:

http://email.uoa.gr/download/squirrelmail/javascript_libs/javascript_libs-0.1.2.tar.gz

Untar it under your squirrelmail/plugins/ directory and enable the plugin in
Squirrelmail.

Signature:
http://email.uoa.gr/download/squirrelmail/javascript_libs/javascript_libs-0.1.2.tar.gz.sig



Upgrading versions
------------------

1) Move the old avelsieve directory aside:
   mv avelsieve avelsieve-prev

2) Untar the new version.

3) Check the documentation (doc/NEWS.html) if there are any new configuration
   options.

4) Copy your previous configuration file, e.g:
   cp ../avelsieve-prev/config/config.php ./config/

5) You can also try a diff with the sample configuration file, if there are any
   changes:
   
   vim -d config_sample.php config.php
   
   Or even better, if you have the "meld" tool (http://meld.sourceforge.net/), you
   can bring your configuration file up to date with just a few clicks:
   
   meld config_sample.php config.php

   
If and only if you are positive that things work as before (or, even, better),
then delete the old directory!
