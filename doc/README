  Introduction

   Avelsieve or, verbosely, "Sieve Mail Filters Plugin for Squirrelmail"
   is a [1]Squirrelmail [2]plugin for creating [3]Sieve scripts on a
   Sieve-compliant mail server.

   Sieve is a mail filtering language, intended for server-side filtering
   of emails. For more information, please visit [4]http://sieve.info or
   read [5]RFC 3028.

   Avelsieve can either run using different backends, with regard to the
   storage of the Sieve scripts. Currently, three backends are available:
    1. ManageSieve: This is the transport protocol for uploading, editing,
       deleting and verifying Sieve scripts on a mail server. A daemon
       usually listens to port 2000, where clients such as avelsieve can
       connect and manage the scripts.
       Examples of server implementations that support ManageSieve:
          + [6]Cyrus IMAPd running timsieved
          + [7]DBMail
          + [8]Isode M-Box
    2. File Backend: For simple storage of scripts in the filesystem. (For
       instance, the Exim MTA supports such scripts).
    3. LDAP Backend: This is a specialized, contributed backend for users
       of Sun Messaging Server.

   More implementations can be found at
   [9]http://sieve.info/implementations.

   In the future, Avelsieve will also be a part of [10]Cyrusmaster, a
   web-based Cyrus administration tool. It should provide the same
   interface of the user's filters to administrators and/or helpdesk
   staff.

  About this implementation

   The web interface provides a wizard-like interface that, in the end,
   creates part of a Sieve script, a so called rule. It then assembles all
   the rules to form a Sieve script.

   For the sake of user-friendliness, it provides only a subset of Sieve's
   functionality; the main goal was to provide a simple interface for Joe
   User to create server-side filters without knowing anything about the
   language itself.

   The plugin does not provide a parser; instead, it saves PHP meta-data
   in the script itself, in order to continue editing and manipulation of
   the filters. The only thing that is supported is a script called
   "phpscript" on the Cyrus server. Multiple scripts are not supported
   yet. I've tried to make it sane enough that it won't break a lot. Some
   more testing is needed - hence the beta status.

  Status

     * Devel Branch (1.9): Considered beta quality.> This release should
       be considered 'beta quality'. At the moment it works for me without
       any major glitches, but who knows, there might be a bug that DoS'es
       the Apache Server by eating all of its memory in there.
     * Stable Branch (1.0):
       This plugin has been out for a while and is known to work pretty
       well. You'll have to check for yourselves if it is for a production
       environment. Insert standard GPL_Disclaimer(); here.

  Features

   This plugin provides:
     * Simple HTML interface.
     * Javascript functionality that enhances the user interaction,
       however there is HTML-only fallback for accessibility.
     * Match messages based on email headers, size, or apply to all
       messages.
     * Configurable number of header matches.
     * Support of keeping a message, move to an existing or new folder,
       email redirection.
     * Supports Sieve Vacation.
     * Supports Sieve Notification action.
     * Create a rule on-the-fly, while reading a message in Squirrelmail.
       This function will auto-detect List-Id: headers for mailing lists.
     * Runs through all the rules, but supports a stop command when a rule
       matches.
     * Change the order of rules - or delete them altogether.
     * Enable / Disable rules on the fly, without deleting them.
     * Make a textual description of the rule.
     * Localizable.
     * Automatic adaption to the capabilities of each site's Sieve.

   ..but does not provide:
     * A Sieve parser. Yet.

  Screenshots

   If you'd like to take some quick look before installing, you can check
   out some [11]screenshots of avelsieve in action.

  Demo

   You can see the plugin in action, if you wish. Check the [12]Live Demo
   page for more information.

  Requirements

     * A Sieve management daemon (ManageSieve-compatible). It has been
       tested with [13]Cyrus IMAP server and its timsieved Sieve parser.
       There have been reports about it working with [14]DBMail, too.
     * [15]Squirrelmail version 1.4.9 or greater.
     * The [16]multibyte string (mbstring) PHP extension is very much
       recommended. It provides very robust conversion between character
       sets. Otherwise, recode or iconv will also do the job.
     * [17]sieve-php.lib, a PHP class for transporting Sieve scripts,
       originally by [18]Dan Ellis. Included.
