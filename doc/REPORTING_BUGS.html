<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p>If you encounter any problems while using avelsieve, you would be much
appreciated to send a bug report.</p>

<p>Please follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Edit your configuration file (config/config.php) and set AVELSIEVE_DEBUG to
1.</li>

<li>Try to recreate the problem. If it has happened due to the generated script
being incorrect, then when avelsieve tries to upload the script again, this
will generate the error and the whole SIEVE script will appear on the
output.</li>

<li>Email a copy of this script, the error message and a description of what
you did to trigger it, to the email address avel &#64;
users.sourceforge.net.</li>

</ol>
